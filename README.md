# Codes

> [!Warning]
This is more like a repository of many of my standalone codes or ones I have worked on with my classmates or outside of class, but it is not a specific project.

Here you will find some codes and implementation of interesting algorithms, such as: Belekamp's algorithm, Karatsuba, Fast Fourier transform and its implementation for efficiently multiplying polynomials, a Binary Algorithm for the GCD, as well as the typical Euclidean and Extended Euclidean algorithms. One that I am particularly proud of is the Kronecker Algorithm, I spent many hours programming it. Anyway, maybe it can be useful to someone.

There are also some things in Python and C++ that either are from subjects or we have used them with for something and university assignments where I once had to program something.
